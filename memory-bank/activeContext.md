# Active Context

## Current Focus
We are implementing a modern lending platform using Supabase as our backend infrastructure. The platform leverages Supabase's powerful features including:
- PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security
- Real-time subscriptions
- Edge Functions for serverless computing
- Built-in authentication and authorization
- Storage for document management

## Recent Changes

### Infrastructure Migration
1. Migrated from traditional Express backend to Supabase
2. Implemented Edge Functions for serverless computing
3. Set up Row Level Security policies for data protection
4. Configured real-time subscriptions for live updates
5. Integrated Supabase authentication system

### Frontend Updates
1. Updated Next.js to version 14 with App Router
2. Implemented Supabase Client integration
3. Added real-time data synchronization
4. Enhanced authentication flows
5. Optimized asset delivery and caching

### Development Environment
1. Added Supabase CLI for local development
2. Updated environment variables for Supabase integration
3. Configured Edge Functions development workflow
4. Enhanced CI/CD pipeline for Supabase deployment
5. Implemented local database seeding

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
1. Using Edge Functions for:
   - Complex calculations
   - Third-party integrations
   - Scheduled tasks
   - Data transformations

2. Database Design:
   - Implementing Row Level Security
   - Optimizing query performance
   - Managing real-time subscriptions
   - Handling data relationships

3. Frontend Strategy:
   - Server Components for static content
   - Client Components for interactive features
   - Optimistic updates for better UX
   - Progressive enhancement

### Security
1. Authentication:
   - Multiple auth providers
   - Role-based access control
   - Session management
   - JWT handling

2. Data Protection:
   - Row Level Security policies
   - Data encryption
   - Secure file storage
   - Audit logging

## Current Considerations

### Performance
1. Edge Function optimization:
   - Cold start mitigation
   - Caching strategies
   - Resource allocation
   - Error handling

2. Database efficiency:
   - Connection pooling
   - Query optimization
   - Index management
   - Cache invalidation

3. Frontend performance:
   - Bundle optimization
   - Image optimization
   - API response caching
   - Real-time sync efficiency

### Scalability
1. Database scaling:
   - Connection limits
   - Storage capacity
   - Query performance
   - Backup strategy

2. Edge Function scaling:
   - Concurrent executions
   - Memory usage
   - Timeout handling
   - Error recovery

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. Complete payment integration
2. Implement document processing
3. Set up monitoring
4. Optimize performance

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Enhance error handling
2. Improve testing coverage
3. Update documentation
4. Implement analytics

### Medium Term (1-2 Months)

2. Stripe for payments
3. SendGrid for emails
4. Document processing services
5. Analytics tools

## Risks
1. Edge Function performance
2. Real-time sync scalability
3. Database connection limits
4. Storage capacity constraints
5. API rate limits
